Prof. Andre Beteille, whom I owe a great deal of intellectual debt, wrote once
that the aim of intellectual pursuit is to scratch the surface of confusion
caused by experience and observation. He wrote this as a social scientist, being
fully aware of the fact that curiosity of a social scientist about a society is
not same thing as the curiosity of a mathematician about numbers. Nonetheless, I
find this claim to be extremely rich about the general nature of intellectual
pursuit.

Is "scratching the surface of confusion caused by experience and observation" is
the purpose of a branch of natural science, or, if I may be too bold, of all
sciences? I'd not push it too far for such a claim brings subjectivity and
subject into foreground while claiming very little for the non-subjective part
of  scholarship, namely methods and routines which each branch of natural
sciences has discovered and perfected over time.

It is useful here to draw a thin line between Science and Scholarship [1].
Science is a pursuit of reality. It has methods which are to be mastered and
perfected in a  workshop before one can strike on one own. I am not denying the
place of intuitions in science, but I believe that there should not be a large
scope of personal virtuosity in science as there is in Jazz or Indian classical
music. If a branch of  natural sciences allows personal virtuosity and
intuitions to take over methods and procedures of  laboratory and workshop, it
only says the such a branch of science is not matured enough in its current
state. To summarize, mimicking Max Weber one can claim that while Science is
slow boring of hard boards; scholarship is flexible enough to accommodate other
sort of intellectual adventures, including the useless and harmless one.

If we agree on that the purpose of science is to scratch the surface of reality
than I have serious issues with philosophy of which there seems to be great
variety. Some branches of philosophies have turned into well established
branches of science. It has been said that what was once known as "Natural
philosophy" is now called physics. I wish to comment on the "field view" of
philosophy which I find around me, rather than its "book view" which is very
hard to grasp unless one is initiated or on its fertility to produce natural
sciences in long run.

First, the scope of methods, facts, and arguments of science must be universal
or universal enough. By X being universal I mean that X should not give a
different result or lead to different conclusion, if applied correctly, merely
because a different person is working with  them or they were applied at a
different times. Universalism does not seem to be a trait of much of Indian
philosophy at  least [2].  Moreover, it is not always clear if reality is the
ultimate aim of philosophy. I am not suggesting that Philosophy, Indian or
non-Indian, should adopt a different framework or approach; or metaphysics is
not worth our attention. But the existing framework tends to undervalue if not
ignore the "principle of reality" which is or ought to be held sacred by
science.

Second, scientists study or at least suppose to study reality as it exists. A
philosopher will not be a philosopher if he does not create alternatives of
reality.  If philosophy is glamorized as a guiding force for humanity, it has to
be said that it can easily turn into an impediment of understanding of reality.
May be I am not philosophically musical, but to me, Philosophy is confusing at
best and misleading at worst. It is in the nature of human mind to mislead
others, not always unknowingly. And philosophy offers vast opportunity to
mislead others and oneself.

Third, newness in science and scholarship is not created because one has a
strong desire to do so, and life of great many people will become better by its
existence.  Philosophy does not seem to have such constraints. One can freely
build theories to his liking. Philosophy can be a healthy recluse from the
harsh, tiring, boring and unpredictable  world of scientific pursuit but it can
easily turn into an opium of intellectuals, especially for those whom the
pursuit of science and scholarship seems to be endlessly tiring and fruitless.
To them, Philosophy seems to offer vast opportunities for the intellectual art
of squaring the circle.
